# 👋🏽 Hey, I'm Tafara —Jr Cloud Engineer 

I design and build end-to-end systems that connect **cloud infrastructure**, **AI models**, and **automation workflows** into real products that solve real problems.

What started as a pursuit of a Junior Cloud Engineer role quickly evolved into something bigger: I was entrusted to build and deploy **AI-powered systems from scratch** — from backend APIs and orchestration layers to vector databases and LLM integrations.

I thrive at the intersection of **DevOps, backend engineering, and applied AI** — where voice turns into insight, workflows become autonomous, and data becomes intelligence.

## 🧠 Core Project: Voice Memory Assistant

A production-grade, AI-powered system that captures raw voice notes, processes them through a semantic pipeline, and enables **meaning-based search** and retrieval.

### 🚀 What It Does
- 🎙️ **Capture:** Record and upload audio directly from the browser.  
- 🧠 **Process:** Transcribe audio, enrich it with a Large Language Model (Gemini), and structure the content intelligently.  
- 🔎 **Search:** Store embeddings in **Qdrant** for semantic search — retrieving information based on meaning, not just keywords.

### 🏗️ Architecture
- 🌐 **Frontend:** Simple browser interface built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, leveraging `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` for voice capture.  
- 🐍 **Backend:** Python Flask API handling requests, routing, and serving results.  
- 🧠 **Processing Layer:** `memory_manager.py` converts text to embeddings with `sentence-transformers` and communicates with **Qdrant** for vector storage.  
- ⚙️ **Orchestration & AI:** Integrated with **n8n** for event-driven workflows and **Gemini LLM** for structuring and enrichment.
