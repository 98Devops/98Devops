# 👋🏽 Hey, I'm Tafara —Jr Cloud & DevOps Engineer 
![Banner](banner.png)

I design and build end-to-end systems that connect **cloud infrastructure**, **AI models**, and **automation workflows** into real products that solve real problems.

I thrive at the intersection of **DevOps, backend engineering, and applied AI** — where voice turns into insight, workflows become autonomous, and data becomes intelligence.
